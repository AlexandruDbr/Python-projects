# Python portfolio

### [1. Excel-data-processing-project-python](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/Excel-data-processing-project-python.git)

The main scope of this project is to manipulate data from multiple excel files stored in a local directory (168 files, with around 50 KB each) by applying a set of transformations, including merging files, new folder creation and data ingestion in a SQL Server database.
Libraries used:

OS module to work with directories and files
Pandas for data manipulation
SQLAlchemy to create new tables and import them in the database



### [2. Scrabble_game_python_project](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/Scrabble_game_python_project.git)
This project partially resembles a scrabble game with 100 pieces.
The project scope is not to emphasise proficiency in game development, but rather a good comprehension of Python functions, lists, dictionaries, strings and control flow. 
Therefore, although I tried to make this game reasonably close to reality by applying most of the rules, 
some of them were not implemented.


### [3. ShoeFly online campaign data analysis](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/ShoeFly-data-analysis-python-project.git)
ShoeFly is a global clothing store who recently lunched an online campaign to promote their new promotional products. Each targeted user was included in one of two groups: A or B. 
The scope of this project was to do the follwing tasks, using **Pandas library**: <br>
    1. Add a new column 'day number' based on 'day' column and delete everything before day name in each cell. <br>
    2. Create a new column to check the users who clicked on the ad called "is_clicked"
    3. Provide the number of users that clicked or not the ad per social media platform. <br>
    4. Create one table based on the original data set, for each target group. <br>
    5. Calculate the percentage of users who clicked the ad from total users for each table, then export both tables in .csv format.


### [4. Boardgame-night-planner-python-project](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/Boardgame-night-planner-python-project.git)
In this project I organised a board game night event by analysing the availability of the guests and creating invitations using the following programming concepts:<br>
* lists
* dictionaries 
* functions
* for loops
* formatted letter strings
* some built-in functions
